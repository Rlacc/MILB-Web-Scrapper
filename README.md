# Nats_Farm_Project
This is a web-scrapping project that scrapes recent nationals minor league games. Select a date or simply input "today" and it will scrape the games from the selected date. Scrapes all minor leage games across all Washington National's minor league affiliate teams and displays the respective statistics of each player during their games. It can also scrape the rankings of each player based on their mlbpipeline ranking.
# Disclamer
**APPLICATION IS OUT OF DATE**
This project was coded in early summer 2023 and unfortunately in August, MILB updated their website to a new design so this scrapper no longer works.
## Important Notes
* The application will not be able to scrape data for dates during the offseason as there are no games (MILB offseason is from (sept/oct-march)
* The .json files containing the ranks will not be updated until you run the update function in the application
